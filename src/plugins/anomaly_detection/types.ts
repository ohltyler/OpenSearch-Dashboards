// TODO: need to figure out the best way to import these data models/interfaces. The path changes depending on
// a dev env or bundled zip env (anomaly-detection-dashboards in dev vs. anomalyDetectionDashboards in bundle)
// May need to redefine some AD data models here (in core). Downside is it requires more maintenance if there is model changes.
// In addition, this import requires 'anomalyDetectionDashboards' to be listed as a required plugin in visualizations plugin
// (see visualizations/opensearch_dashboards.json)
